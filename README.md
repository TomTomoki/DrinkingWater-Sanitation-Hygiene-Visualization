**Project Title:** Drinking Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) Analysis

 

**Team Name:** Shabu Shabu

 

**Deployed App:** https://teamshabushabu.shinyapps.io/shinyapp/ (with 2020-only map data)

 

**Summary:**
Access to clean and safe drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene is a fundamental human right and a critical determinant of health and well-being. However, millions of people worldwide lack access to these necessities. [WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP)](https://washdata.org/data/downloads#WLD) collected and managed this household dataset by estimating the values for each country.

 

This project proposes a comprehensive analysis of household drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene worldwide by providing visualization from various perspective. The visualization helps to discover the status quo, compare trends between regions and/or countries, and track whether JPM's 2030 vision of "universal access to basic services" will be achieved promptly.
